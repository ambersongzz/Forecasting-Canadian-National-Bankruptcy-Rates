# Forecasting-Canadian-National-Bankruptcy-Rates
The goal of this analysis is to model and forecast monthly bankruptcy rates for Canada. The dataset we will be working with includes monthly data on bankruptcy rates along with unemployment rate, housing price index and population. Bankruptcy rate data ranges from January 1987 to December 2010. Data on the remaining variables is also available for the period we want to predict; January 2011 to December 2012. This allows us to use the additional variables in order to aid our prediction of bankruptcy rates. Our goal, therefore, is to come up with an optimal predictive model that will allow us to forecast Canadian bankruptcy rates between January 2011 and December 2012.
